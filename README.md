# Machine Learning Project
## Overview
### This project explores the application of various classification and regression algorithms in the domain of [briefly mention your project domain].

## Steps Involved
## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

### Gathered relevant data and cleaned it by handling missing values and outliers.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### Analyzed and visualized data to understand underlying patterns and distributions.
## Feature Engineering:

### Selected, created, or transformed features to improve model performance.
## Model Selection:

### Experimented with multiple classification and regression algorithms to find the best performers.

## Model Evaluation:

### Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification, and MSE, MAE, and R-squared for regression.
## Interpretability and Visualization:

### Visualized decision boundaries, feature importances, or SHAP values to interpret model behavior.
